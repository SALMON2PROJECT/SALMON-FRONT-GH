# THIS LIBRARY DOES NOT WORK ON CORS PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTS: CHROME, FIREFOX, SAFARI, ETC

Pure js library that allows you to extract information from a URL or parse text and retrieve information from the first available link.

## On the naming and runnable environments
Library should work on node environments (thanks @uriva and @itaibs), library retains it's original name because it was originally created to work on react-native (and re-publishing on npm might break stuff), it is a generic js library so it should work wherever you can run JS, EXCEPT:

Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO DO CROSS SITE REQUESTS therefore you cannot use this library or even manually request another domain from your web browser application (read more about CORS https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

## Getting started

`$ npm install -S react-native-link-preview`

or

`$ yarn add react-native-link-preview`

## Usage
Library exposes just one method: getPreview, you have to pass a string (doesn't matter if it is just a URL or a piece of text that contains a URL), the library will take care of parsing it and returning the info of first valid URL info it finds.

URL parsing is done via: https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294

```javascript
import LinkPreview from 'react-native-link-preview';

...

LinkPreview.getPreview('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MejbOFk7H6c')
  .then(data => console.debug(data));

LinkPreview.getPreview('This is a text supposed to be parsed and the first link displayed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MejbOFk7H6c')
  .then(data => console.debug(data));
```
## Options
Additionally you can pass an options object which should add more functionality to the parsing of the link

| Property Name | Result        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| imagesPropertyType  (**optional**) (ex: 'og')     | Fetches images only with the specified property, `meta[property='${imagesPropertyType}:image']` |


```javascript
LinkPreview.getPreview(
  'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MejbOFk7H6c',
  {
    imagesPropertyType: 'og', // fetches only open-graph images
  })
  .then(data => console.debug(data));
```


## Returns
Returns a Promise that resolves with an object describing the provided link.
The info object returned varies depending on the content type (MIME type) returned
in the HTTP response (see below for variations of response).  Rejects with an error if response can not be parsed or if there was no URL in the text provided.
